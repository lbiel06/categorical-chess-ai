# Categorical evaluation of chess positions using neural networks
The aim of this project was to create a neural network capable of classifying chess positions into 3 categories: winning for black (0), balanced (1), and winning for white (2). Categories were assigned based on the score calculated by Stockfish 15.1 depth 10. The dataset consisted of 100 000 randomly generated positions.

After 25 epochs of training, the model achieved a validation accuracy of 77%.
